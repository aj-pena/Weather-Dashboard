## Description

This is an application run from the browser that allows the user to search for the current and 5-day forecast of the weather in a specific City.
Weather can affect our choices regarding activites, mode of transportation, schedules and clothes that we wear. For this reason, it is important to have some idea of the expected kind of weather for the coming days. This application helps the user make more informed decisions that are affected by weather conditions by allowing him/her/they to access the current weather and the 5-day forecast.
